# csevpn

1. Download the setup files in Ubuntu Linux.
Setup files: cse-ipsecvpn.zip

'$ cd'
'$ unzip cse-ipsecvpn.zip'
'$ cd cse-ipsecvpn/'
'$ sudo ./vpn_setup.sh'

3. After the cse-ipsecvpn connection is added, you need to enter your CSE username in
VPN Settings -> VPN / Identity -> User Name.
You may leave Password field blank. The system will ask for your Linux account password every time you connect to the VPN.

4. If you donâ€™t want to tunnel all the Internet traffic through CSE VPN, set / select following checkbox.
*Ubuntu 18.04*
VPN Settings -> IPv4 -> Use this connection only for resources on its network
*Ubuntu 16.04*
VPN Settings -> IPv4 Settings -> Routes -> Use this connection only for resources on its network
Both verions, using nmcli command
'$ sudo nmcli conn modify cse-ipsecvpn ipv4.never-default true'
'$ sudo nmcli conn reload cse-ipsecvpn'
With this option, you can

 * Access CSE network (IP subnet 137,189.88.0/255.255.252.0) through CSE VPN
 * Access Internet through your wired / wireless connection
